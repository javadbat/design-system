# JB Design System

Collection of necessary components to build a web Application with web-components & react components.

- mostly focus on form elements and complicated elements with high user interactivity.
- all components are written in web-component with additional React component wrapper around them(access them with "component-name/react").
- first class support for RTL and persian i18n utilities.

we have 2 kind of components here:

1. form base component:    
  used in form to get values from user.

2. non-form components:    
  everything that can't be  used inside forms.

## Styling Guide

Due to the nature of web-components and shadow DOM we can't use css-in-js approach for styling. so we have to use css native ways like custom properties to style our components.
